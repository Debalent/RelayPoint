# Manager Script — Device Rollout & Pilot Briefing

Use this script for the manager training session (30–60 minutes) and for quick huddles with staff when handing out devices.

1) Opening (2 mins)
- "Thanks team — we're running a short pilot to help make your day-to-day easier. These iPads are company devices to help with task tracking and coordination. This is not about tracking you; it's about making your work smoother."

2) Why we're doing this (3 mins)
- Explain pain points heard from staff and managers (room turnover delays, missed tasks, phone fragmentation).
- "We're testing a small set of devices and a dock workflow to see if it reduces dropped tasks and makes shift handovers easier."

3) Device basics (5 mins)
- Show the iPad and dock. Demonstrate per-shift login (PIN/QR/badge) and how to start and end a session.
- Explain Single App Mode: "You'll only see RelayPoint on these devices — nothing else."

4) Docking & clock-out flow (5 mins)
- "At end of shift, place the iPad in the dock. The dock tells the system the device is returned and submits a clock‑out request. If you ever have to leave in an emergency and can't dock, tell your manager immediately — they will approve the clock-out."
- Emphasize the policy: docking is expected, but won't prevent you from leaving in emergencies.

5) Handling issues (5 mins)
- Lost/stolen/broken: Who to call (manager → IT/support contact)
- Dock health: who to contact if a dock isn't charging
- If you forget to dock: tell your manager; they'll help reconcile time entries.

6) Quick role card for staff (give printed card)
- Steps: pick device → authenticate → follow daily checklist → complete tasks → dock at shift end → confirm session closed

7) Q&A (10–15 mins)
- Encourage honesty. Capture objections or legal/HR concerns and escalate.

8) Wrap-up (2 mins)
- Reassure staff: this is a short pilot; we’ll ask for feedback and may change things based on their input.
- Ask each manager to sign a short acknowledgment confirming staff were briefed.
