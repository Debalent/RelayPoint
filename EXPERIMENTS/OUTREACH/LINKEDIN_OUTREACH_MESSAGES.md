LinkedIn Outreach Messages — RelayPoint Pilot

Context: Use for poll hand-raisers and targeted 10–20 prospect outreach. Personalize tokens in brackets [] before sending.

Initial DM (Day 0 — short, personalize):

Hi [Name], thanks for engaging with my poll — I’m Demond from RelayPoint.
Quick Q: would you be open to a 15‑min workflow triage to see if a short 6‑week pilot could reduce housekeeping/maintenance friction at [Property Name]? Book here: [booking-link]
If you prefer, I can send a short pilot summary + MOU.

— Demond

Follow-up DM 1 (Day 3 if no reply):

Hi [Name], circling back — we have a couple pilot slots open and I thought [Property] might be a great fit. A 15‑min triage is the fastest way to see fit: [booking-link]

Follow-up DM 2 (Day 7–10 final nudge):

Hi [Name], final heads-up — we’re finalizing pilot spots for the month. If you want to reserve a spot quickly, you can claim it with a refundable $250 deposit here: [payment-link]

Reply templates (use after they say Yes / Questions / Objection):

If they say Yes / Booked:
Thanks [Name] — appreciate it. I’ll send a short pre-call checklist (wifi test + point of contact) and the 1‑page MOU for review. If you want to reserve the slot now, you can claim it with a refundable $250 deposit: [payment-link]

If they ask for details (send pilot one-pager briefly):
Sure — short summary below. Pilot = 6 weeks, turnkey setup (we can supply devices or use your devices), focus on housekeeping & maintenance, weekly reports. Want me to email the one-pager and the MOU?

If they push back on deposit:
Totally understood. We can hold the slot pending a short triage call; deposit just helps prioritize limited pilot spots and is fully refundable if you cancel 7+ days before start or if you choose not to proceed after the pilot.

Objection: "We don't have bandwidth"
I get it. The triage call is 15 minutes and we handle most of the setup; we can limit manager time and do the rest via the point person you choose. If useful I can step through exact tasks to minimize disruption.

Close / Ask for Commitment (on call):
We’ll run a 6-week pilot focused on [top pain]. If you’re happy, we can reserve a slot now — either schedule the kickoff or I can send the $250 deposit link to hold your place.

Tracking notes:
- Always add each outreach to `PROSPECT_TEMPLATE.csv` with date, response, and next action.
- Use UTM-coded booking links so bookings via the outreach are tracked.
- Log deposits and MOU signatures in the same CSV.
