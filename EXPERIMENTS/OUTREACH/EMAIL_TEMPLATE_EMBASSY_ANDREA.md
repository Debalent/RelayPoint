Hi Andrea —

Nice meeting you at the holiday event — and congrats to Hope on the recognition.

I’m putting together a limited test of RelayPoint that automates checkout → turnover tasks and gives a simple KPI view for managers. Would you be open to a brief 10–15 minute chat when we enter the testing phase to see if it’d be relevant for your operations? No obligation — just a quick check to see fit.

If so, I’ll send a one‑pager and suggested times. Best,

— Demond (RelayPoint)
