Subject: Quick question — pilot interest for Embassy Suites by Hilton Tulsa I44

Hi David —

It was great meeting you at the holiday gathering — and congrats again to Hope on her recognition. Your comment about how significant others absorb the work drama really stuck with me; it’s one of the reasons I’m building RelayPoint.

I’m preparing a small test of RelayPoint (checkout → automated turnover tasks → simple KPI dashboard). RelayPoint is designed to **consolidate notifications, messaging and task workflows into a single system**, so teams don’t need multiple apps to manage checkouts, assignments and manager reporting. I wanted to ask whether you might be open to hearing about a short pilot when we move into testing. No commitment — just a 10–15 minute intro to see whether it might be relevant for Embassy Suites Tulsa.

If that sounds useful, I can send a one‑page summary and a couple of short times for a quick chat. Thanks for your time.
