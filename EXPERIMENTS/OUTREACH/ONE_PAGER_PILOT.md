RelayPoint — 6‑Week Pilot Summary

Objective
- Reduce average room turnover time and reduce manager firefighting time by automating checkout → turnover workflows and providing basic KPI visibility.

Scope
- Integration: listen to PMS checkout events (Cloudbeds PoC) for a subset of rooms/floors.
- Automation: auto‑create turnover tasks and route them to assigned housekeepers; push real‑time notifications.
- Reporting: weekly KPI snapshot showing avg turnover time, % on‑SLA, and manager time estimates.

Duration & Setup
- Duration: 6 weeks (1 week setup + 5 operational weeks)
- Setup steps: small config call, map rooms (we’ll help), deploy to 10–30 rooms for initial test.

Success Metrics (examples)
- Target: reduce avg turnover time by 15–30 minutes OR increase on‑SLA completions to ≥90%.
- Secondary: decrease in missed/duplicate tasks; manager hours saved per week.

Deliverables
- Weekly KPI updates and short status notes
- Dashboard snapshot and pilot review with recommendation at end

Logistics
- Pilot is low‑risk and optional; if useful we’ll work out the scale and next steps after the pilot.

Next step
- 10–15 minute workflow triage to confirm baseline metrics and scope. I’ll send a short MOU once we agree on scope.
