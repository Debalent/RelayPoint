DM Snippets — Quick copy/paste (short + medium + deposit)

SHORT (Quick reply to hand-raiser)
Hi [Name], thanks for voting — I’m Demond from RelayPoint. Quick Q: would you be open to a 15‑min workflow triage to see if a short 6‑week pilot could reduce housekeeping/maintenance friction at [Property Name]? Reply here or email balentinetechsolutions@gmail.com with subject "Pilot: [Property Name]" to book.

MEDIUM (If they ask for details)
Thanks [Name] — short summary: Pilot = 6 weeks, turnkey (we can supply devices), focus on housekeeping & maintenance, weekly reports and a 1‑page MOU. Want me to email the one‑pager and MOU or shall I send available times for a 15‑min triage?

DEPOSIT / RESERVE (if prospects want to prioritize slot)
We can hold a slot pending a triage call, or you can reserve it now with a refundable $250 deposit — fully refundable 7+ days before start or if you choose not to proceed after the pilot. Reply if you want the payment link.

CONFIRMATION (copy/paste into email if booking via email)
Subject: Booking Confirmation — RelayPoint Pilot: [Property Name]

Hi [Name],
Thanks for booking the triage. I’ll send available times shortly. Please reply with your preferred times or confirm and I’ll send calendar invite + pre-call checklist and the 1‑page MOU.

— Demond
