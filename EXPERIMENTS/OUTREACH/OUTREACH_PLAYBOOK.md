Outreach Playbook — 10–20 Targeted Prospects

Goal: Convert LinkedIn poll hand-raisers into pilot triage calls, booked pilots (MOU or refundable $250 deposit), and Wizard‑of‑Oz pilot participants.

Steps:
1. Prepare list: populate `PROSPECT_TEMPLATE.csv` with 10–20 hand-raisers from poll results.
2. Personalize message: add property name + short note from poll comment.
3. Send Initial DM (Day 0) using `LINKEDIN_OUTREACH_MESSAGES.md` template.
4. If no reply, send Follow-up DM 1 at Day 3; final nudge at Day 7–10.
5. When prospect replies with interest: send booking link (UTM), optionally send MOU and deposit link.
6. On booking: add to tracking CSV, send confirmation email with pre-call checklist and MOU link.
7. After triage call: if fit, request deposit or MOU signature to reserve the pilot slot and schedule kickoff.
8. For each site confirmed, prepare Wizard-of-Oz consent and tracking (use `WIZARD_OF_OZ_CHECKLIST_AND_CONSENT.md` and tracking templates).

Metrics / Targets (for first 10–20 outreach):
- Replies showing interest: >= 3 (15%)
- Booked triage calls: >= 3
- Confirmed pilots (deposit or signed MOU): >= 2

Best practices:
- Personalize the first line with a specific detail from their comment.
- Prefer LinkedIn DM; send an email if LinkedIn not available.
- Use a short, clear CTA: book triage or reply "interested".
- Keep notes in `PROSPECT_TEMPLATE.csv` and update daily.

Security & privacy:
- Use company email (demond.balentine@outlook.com) for formal documents and MOU links.
- Use Stripe or secure payment provider for deposits; provide invoice/PO option if needed.

Next steps I can do now:
- Pull hand-raisers from your LinkedIn poll (if you want me to, I need the list or access).
- Populate `PROSPECT_TEMPLATE.csv` with actual names/links if you provide them.
- Draft the deposit landing page copy (payment wording + refund policy) and a short email template for deposit confirmation.
