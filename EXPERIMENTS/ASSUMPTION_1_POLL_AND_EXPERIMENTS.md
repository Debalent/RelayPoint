Assumption #1: Pain & Authority (Market Risk)

Operations managers with buying or persuading authority at mid-size hotels experience severe workflow pain and are actively seeking, and willing to implement, new solutions—despite industry inertia.

LinkedIn Poll + CTA (Ready-to-Post)

Post text (intro):
"Hotel operations managers — quick check: How severe are task coordination and workflow issues for your property right now? We're prototyping a simple workflow assistant (devices + AI) to reduce friction for rooms, maintenance, and shift handoffs. If this resonates, DM me or book a 15-min workflow triage: [booking-link]"

Poll question:
"How severe is task coordination & workflow pain in your hotel's operations today?"
Options (4):
- Critical — severely impacting operations
- Significant — noticeable, recurring impact
- Manageable — occasional issues, tolerable
- Minimal/None — not a problem for us

CTA guidance:
- Include the booking link and a short CTA in the post body: "DM me or book a 15-min workflow triage: [booking-link]"
- Add hashtags: #hotelops #hospitality #operations #hotelier #hospitalitytech
- Post to hospitality ops groups and personal timeline; pin the post and reshare in 3 days with a short update.

Follow-up DM template for "hand-raisers"

Hi [Name],

Thanks for engaging with the poll — I appreciate it. We're running a short 6-week pilot to test a workflow assistant that reduces time-to-resolve and task handoffs. Quick Qs so I can qualify your fit:
- How many rooms does your property have? (approx)
- What’s the top workflow pain today? (e.g., room-ready handoffs, maintenance response, housekeeping coordination)
- Would you be available for a 15-min triage call this week? I can tentatively hold [two time slots].

If you’re interested in piloting, we can reserve your spot with a small refundable deposit ($250) or a brief pilot MOU — both protect your spot and ensure commitment.

Thanks — Demond

Micro-commitment & Booking Flow
- Link to a short Calendly/HubSpot booking page that captures: property name, role/title, number of rooms, top workflow pain, preferred pilot start window.
- Use UTM parameters on booking links for tracking.

Behavioral uplift: Pricing/Deposit/MOU test
- Offer a refundable deposit or sign an MOU to raise the behavioral bar.
- Success metric: ≥2/10 prospects pay deposit or sign MOU within 14 days of invite.

Experiment tracking & metrics (LinkedIn poll)
- Primary metrics:
  - % of respondents selecting "Critical" or "Significant" (target >= 30% combined)
  - Number of direct DMs/comments from ops managers (target >= 5 within 7 days)
  - Number of booked triage calls from the post (target >= 5 within 7 days)
- Secondary metrics:
  - Click-throughs to booking link (use UTM + shortener)
  - Replies that include qualification info (rooms, pain specifics)

Posting & timing recommendations
- Best times: Tue–Thu mornings (local timezone of target audience)
- Post in Hotelier/Hospitality Ops groups and reshare in relevant threads
- If initial reach is low, boost with small sponsored post budget ($50) targeted at "Hotel Operations Managers" in selected regions

Four experiments for Assumption #1 (documented)

1) LinkedIn Poll + CTA
- What: Poll + CTA to DM / book a 15-min triage
- Success: >=30% respondents choose "Critical/Significant" AND >=5 ops managers DM/book within 7 days
- Timeline: 7 days

2) Fake-Door / Pilot Invite Email Test
- What: Send 20 targeted pilot-invite messages/emails offering a no-cost 6-week pilot (deposit/MOU option)
- Success: >=3 of 20 (15%) respond and schedule discovery/pilot set-up
- Timeline: 10 days

3) Discovery Interview -> Pilot Commitment
- What: Run 5 interviews using script; close by booking pilot kick-off
- Success: >=3 of 5 (60%) say "yes" and tentatively book pilot kick-off
- Timeline: 14 days

4) Pricing/Commitment Test (Deposit or MOU)
- What: Offer a refundable deposit or pilot MOU on invitation to raise behavioral commitment
- Success: >=2 of 10 (20%) pay deposit or sign within 14 days
- Timeline: 14 days

Operational notes
- Use UTM and short links for booking to identify traffic from the poll vs outreach.
- Record all engaged contacts in a simple CRM spreadsheet with columns: Name, Role, Property, Rooms, Pain, Response Type (DM/book), Follow-up status, Deposit/MOU status.

Next steps I can do now:
- Finalize LinkedIn post copy and format it for easy posting
- Create a Calendly booking page copy (fields + confirmation language) and a short MOU template
- Draft the pilot-invite email sequence (initial invite, follow-up, deposit/MOU language)

Tell me which you'd like me to prepare next and I’ll implement it.
