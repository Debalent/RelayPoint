Hotel Operations Niche Strategy — RelayPoint Elite

Goal: Focus RelayPoint on hotel operations (housekeeping & maintenance) to achieve rapid product-market fit and build a defensible vertical offering.

Why hotel ops?
- Clear, repeatable workflows (housekeeping, maintenance, turnover) with measurable KPIs
- Large addressable market: independent hotels, boutique chains, regional operators
- Integration-dependent (PMS + task systems) creates moat once integrated
- High business value: reduced labor costs, improved guest experience, lower overtime

Target customer segments
- Boutique & independent hotels (50–150 rooms) — easy sales with single decision-makers
- Regional small chains (100–500 rooms across properties) — central procurement
- Urban business hotels (higher turnover) — need better task orchestration

Buyer personas
- Director of Operations / Head of Operations — primary champion
- Front Office Manager — integration with PMS critical
- Housekeeping Manager — day-to-day operational user
- IT/Procurement — integration & security evaluator

Phase 1 MVP (90 days) — Hotel-focused
- Core workflow: Housekeeping task assignment + completion flow
- Mobile app features for housekeepers: task list, photo upload on completion, offline mode, push notifications
- Manager dashboard (web): real-time task board, shift view, basic analytics (task completion rate, turnaround)
- One PMS integration: Cloudbeds (room status sync, check-in/out triggers)
- Booking & pilot ops: pilot MOU, booking flow, deposit option
- Success metrics: 3 paying pilot customers, 10% reduction in manager time on pilot properties, signed MOU conversion >=10%

PMS priority list
- Cloudbeds (priority for MVP)
- Mews / Cloudbeds alternatives for pilot partners
- Opera/Infor (large enterprise integrations later)

Pilot partner criteria
- 50–150 rooms
- Willing to provide historical task logs and staff schedules
- Open to 6-week pilot with weekly check-ins
- Willing to be an early reference/customer

GTM & Pricing
- Pilot pricing: discounted pilot with refundable $250 deposit to prioritize spots
- Post-pilot pricing: $500/property/month for single property; volume discounts for chains
- Channels: hospitality operator groups, trade associations, PMS partnerships, direct outreach

Engineering & Team priorities (first 6 months)
- 2 senior engineers (backend, mobile), 1 full-stack, 1 product designer, 1 QA/DevOps
- Focus sprints: PMS integration + offline mobile capabilities + manager UX

Data & Metrics
- Data to collect during pilots: task volumes, time-per-task, staff-hours-scheduled, staff-hours-actual, task completion times, guest complaints tying to tasks
- Use experiments tracking templates (EXPERIMENTS/ANALYTICS) and the forecasting pipeline to measure impact

Risks & Mitigations
- PMS access delays: mitigate via signed pilot agreements & sandbox accounts
- Data quality: collect sample logs and validate ETL prior to pilot
- Low adoption: keep pilot manager time minimal and automate setup (we offer devices if needed)

Next steps (immediate)
1. Create Cloudbeds integration spec & PoC plan (endpoints, auth, test data needs)
2. Finalize Phase 1 PRD and break into GitHub issues/milestones
3. Recruit 3 design partners and set pilot schedules
4. Build mobile offline-first task completion flow and manager dashboard MVP
