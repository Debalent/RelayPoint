Email 1 — Initial Invite (Day 0)
Subject: Quick pilot opportunity — streamline ops at [Property Name]

Hi [Name],

Thanks for engaging with our recent post — your note caught my attention. We’re running a short, focused 6-week pilot with a few mid-size hotels to validate a workflow assistant that reduces task handoffs and speeds resolution for housekeeping and maintenance.

What we offer:
- Turnkey pilot: we can provide pre-configured devices (if useful), or install on your existing devices
- Low setup: we handle imaging/enrollment and onboarding; minimal manager time required
- Clear metrics: weekly reports on resolution time, assignment acceptance, and task completion

Behavioral commitment options (pick one):
- Refundable deposit: $250 (reserved spot, fully refundable if you cancel before pilot start)
- Pilot MOU: sign a short MOU that outlines scope and data handling

If this sounds useful, please book a 15-minute workflow triage so we can see if your property is a good fit: [booking-link-placeholder]

Or reply and I’ll send the MOU and payment link directly.

Best,
Demond J Balentine

Email 2 — Follow-up (Day 3)
Subject: Quick follow-up — pilot spots filling for December

Hi [Name],

Just checking in — we have a few pilot slots left this month and would love to see if [Property Name] is a fit. If you’re interested, a 15-minute triage is the fastest way to confirm.

Thanks,
Demond

Email 3 — Final Nudge (Day 10)
Subject: Last call — reserve a pilot spot with refundable deposit

Hi [Name],

We’re finalizing pilot participants this week. If you want to reserve a spot, you can either book a triage call or claim a spot with a $250 refundable deposit here: [payment-link-placeholder]

I’m happy to answer any quick questions.

LinkedIn Message (short)
Hi [Name], thanks for engaging on my poll. Are you open to a short 15-min call to see if our 6-week pilot could reduce housekeeping/maintenance friction at [Property]? Book: [booking-link-placeholder]

Deposit / Payment Language (clear & fair)
- The $250 deposit reserves your pilot slot and is fully refundable if you cancel at least 7 days before the pilot start date (or immediately refunded if we cancel). It’s refundable upon completion if you choose not to proceed to paid licensing.
- Payment options: Stripe link, invoice, or PO + MOU (we can accept a signed MOU in lieu of deposit).

Short Pilot MOU (link to MOU addendum) — key points
- Parties and dates
- Pilot scope: categories of automation allowed (e.g., housekeeping, low-priority maintenance)
- Data & confidentiality: what we collect and how it’s used (limited to pilot analysis; anonymized reporting on request)
- Withdrawal & refund policy

Calendar booking fields (recommended)
- Name, Role/Title
- Property name and address
- Number of rooms
- Top workflow pain (short text)
- Preferred pilot start window
- Would you like RelayPoint-managed devices? (Yes/No)
- Would you like to reserve a spot with a refundable deposit? (Yes/No)

Confirmation & Next Steps (post-booking)
- Send confirmation email immediately with: booking details, brief pilot checklist, link to MOU, deposit instructions, and expected pre-pilot timelines.
- Attach a one-page pilot checklist for managers: what we need (point of contact, WiFi test, staff orientation) and expected timelines.

Reporting & Success Criteria
- Weekly snapshots: assignment acceptance rate, override rate, mean time-to-resolution
- Post-pilot retro: measured change in resolution time and recommended next steps

Privacy & Legal Notes
- Include minimal data-use language up front and link to full privacy policy
- For any action that may affect payroll, safety, or legal compliance we will get explicit written approval beforehand

Next steps I can do now:
- Create a short booking page copy ready to paste into Calendly
- Draft the one-page MOU addendum (I will create this file as well)
- Draft the deposit payment landing page copy and refund policy text

Which of those should I prepare next?
