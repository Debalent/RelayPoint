Subject: Request for quote & ABM enrollment assistance — iPad + docks for pilot

Hi [Vendor Rep],

We’re preparing a small pilot for RelayPoint (hospitality operations software) and need a procurement quote and assistance with Apple Business Manager (ABM) enrollment and device assignment.

Pilot requirements (initial order):
- Quantity: 14 iPads (12 active + 2 spares)
  - Preferred: standard iPad (10.9") Wi‑Fi, 64GB (please provide alternatives/refurb options)
- Rugged cases/mounts: 14 units (compatible with chosen iPad)
- Charging docks (secure, commercial): 12 units (lockable or secure mount)
- Shipping to: [Ship-to address — will supply]

Services requested:
- Volume price per item and total (include warranty options)
- ABM enrollment & assignment to MDM (please describe process and any reseller steps)
- Recommended MDM partners and license pricing (Jamf, Mosyle, Kandji, Intune)
- Lead time and availability
- Spares / replacement policy

Notes:
- We are finalizing our LLC/EIN but want to secure pricing. Can you provide a pro forma quote that we can convert to an order once we supply our business details? If not, please advise whether you accept a one-time personal purchase that we will later reassign.

Please reply with pricing tiers (new vs refurbished), recommended part numbers, and any volume discounts at your earliest convenience.

Thanks,
Demond J Balentine
