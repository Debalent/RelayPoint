# RelayPoint: The Operational Command Center for High-Velocity Teams

**Real-time, bilingual, mobile-first platform that unifies communication, tasks, scheduling, analytics—and now with seamless light/dark theming and branded logo support.**

---

## 🔥 Executive Summary  
RelayPoint solves the fragmentation of frontline operations by providing a single digital hub where hourly staff, managers, and executives collaborate seamlessly. From instant messaging tied to tasks, to shift checklists, work orders, time tracking, billing logs, and beyond—RelayPoint streamlines daily workflows, boosts accountability, and elevates guest, patient, and customer experiences.  

---

## 🎯 The Problem  
- **Disconnected Tools**: Teams juggle chat apps, paper checklists, spreadsheets, and legacy systems—leading to missed requests and inconsistent service.  
- **Frontline Bias**: Hourly staff (cleaners, cooks, drivers) lack desktop access; managers scramble to coordinate via phone calls and sticky notes.  
- **Accountability Gaps**: No single source of truth for work orders, service recoveries, timesheets, or departmental reference data.  
- **High Turnover**: Role-based knowledge lives in heads—when people leave, critical processes and contacts disappear.  

---

1. **Unifies Communication & Tasks**

5. **Drives Data-Driven Leadership**
