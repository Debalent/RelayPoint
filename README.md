# RelayPoint  
AI-Augmented, Low-Code Workflow Automation Engine  

Real-time, drag-and-drop platform for business users and developers to compose, deploy, and monitor resilient automations across any SaaS stack.  

---

## 🔥 Executive Summary  

RelayPoint replaces brittle scripts and manual ticket queues with a visual, low-code canvas. Business teams can build workflows—like Slack → Google Sheets → Jira—then add enterprise features (retries, rollback, audit trails) and an AI “workflow coach” for proactive suggestions and anomaly alerts.

## 🎯 Core Features  

- **Visual Workflow Builder**  
  Drag in connectors, link triggers and actions, arrange error paths, and publish in seconds.

- **AI Workflow Coach**  
  Inline guidance suggests optimizations (parallelize steps, add retries), flags anomalies, and recommends alerting policies.

- **Enterprise-Grade Resilience**  
  Automatic retries, rollback primitives, timeouts, and per-run audit trails ensure reliability.

- **Open-Source Connector Library**  
  Community-driven modules for Slack, Google Sheets, Jira, Salesforce, email, CRMs, and more.

- **Modular, Microservices-Friendly Architecture**  
  Each connector lives in its own container—scale and secure services independently.

- **Observability & Monitoring**  
  Live run logs, dashboards for throughput/error rates, customizable alerts via Slack or email.
