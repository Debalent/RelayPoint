Step model for RelayPoint's SQLAlchemy ORM.

This module defines the Step model, representing individual steps (triggers or actions)
within workflows in RelayPoint's AI-augmented, low-code workflow automation engine.
It supports async operations with TimescaleDB, includes audit fields for compliance,
and integrates with Auth0-based RBAC through workflow and project relationships.
The model is designed for scalability and compatibility with Alembic migrations.

WHY IT MATTERS FOR INVESTORS:
- Scalability: Supports high-throughput workflow execution with TimescaleDB and async
  operations, ideal for enterprise workloads.
- Reliability: Audit fields (created_at, updated_at) ensure consistent tracking, aligning
  with enterprise SLAs.
- Compliance: Audit-ready fields and relationships meet GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2 requirements,
  appealing to regulated industries like finance and healthcare.
- Security: Integrates with Auth0-based RBAC via workflow and project relationships.
- Developer Productivity: Type-safe model definitions and clear documentation streamline
  development, reducing time-to-market.
- Market Alignment: Supports RelayPoint's core value proposition of low-code automation
  with AI augmentation, targeting a $140.80B agentic AI market by 2032 (39.3% CAGR).
