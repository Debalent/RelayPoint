Team model for RelayPoint's SQLAlchemy ORM.

This module defines the Team model, representing groups of users managing projects and
workflows in RelayPoint's AI-augmented, low-code workflow automation engine. It supports
async operations with TimescaleDB, includes audit fields for compliance, and integrates
with Auth0-based RBAC through user and project relationships. The model is designed for
scalability and compatibility with Alembic migrations.

WHY IT MATTERS FOR INVESTORS:
- Scalability: Supports high-throughput team and project data with TimescaleDB and async
  operations, ideal for enterprise workloads.
- Reliability: Audit fields (created_at, updated_at) ensure consistent tracking, aligning
  with enterprise SLAs.
- Compliance: Audit-ready fields and relationships meet GDPR, HIPAA, and SOC 2 requirements,
  appealing to regulated industries like finance and healthcare.
- Security: Integrates with Auth0-based RBAC via user and project relationships.
- Developer Productivity: Type-safe model definitions and clear documentation streamline
  development, reducing time-to-market.
- Market Alignment: Supports RelayPoint's core value proposition of low-code automation
  with AI augmentation, targeting a $140.80B agentic AI market by 2032 (39.3% CAGR).
