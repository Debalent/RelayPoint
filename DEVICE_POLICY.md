# Device Use Policy — RelayPoint iPad Pilot

Purpose
-------
This operational policy explains expectations for company‑provided iPads used during the RelayPoint pilot. This is a non‑legal template: please obtain HR and legal review before wide deployment.

Scope
-----
Applies to all staff participating in the RelayPoint pilot using company‑issued iPads and docking stations.

Key Points
----------
- **Company Property:** iPads, docks, and related accessories are company property and must be used for work duties.
- **Work‑Only Devices:** Devices are provisioned for business use. Personal apps and accounts are not permitted on pilot devices.
- **Per‑Shift Login:** Staff must authenticate at shift start (PIN/QR/badge). Each session is logged to the system for audit and attribution.
- **Dock Return:** Staff should return the assigned iPad to its assigned dock at shift end. Dock events produce a device‑returned signal to the backend/timekeeping system to simplify shift closeout.
- **Exceptions & Manager Override:** If an emergency prevents docking, staff must notify their manager immediately. Managers can approve manual overrides and record exceptions.
- **Loss & Damage:** Report lost, stolen, or damaged devices immediately. The company will follow replacement/repair procedures and notify IT/security.
- **Privacy & Monitoring:** Devices are managed by company MDM and are subject to basic monitoring for security and operational purposes (device health, app usage, audit logs). Personal data should not be stored on company devices.

Notes
-----
- This policy intentionally avoids hard enforcement that would prevent employees from clocking out or leaving in an emergency. Use the dock as a trusted signal rather than a hard lock unless legal counsel approves a different approach.
- For production deployments, include procedures for discipline, replacement costs, and local law compliance after HR and counsel review.
