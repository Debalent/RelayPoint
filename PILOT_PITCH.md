Subject: Quick pilot opportunity — improve shift coordination with company iPads

Hi [Name],

I’m Demond, founder of RelayPoint. My wife works in hotels and I’ve been speaking with ops teams about the constant coordination problems that slow down room turn, increase guest issues, and wear staff out.

We’re running a short 6-week pilot to test a simple, low-risk approach: company‑managed iPads (preloaded with RelayPoint), secure docks that signal device return, and a lightweight per-shift workflow that reduces missed tasks and speeds handoffs.

What we provide (no cost for pilot):
- Managed iPads + rugged cases and docks (fully configured)
- Setup, training for managers and quick role cards for staff
- 6-week pilot with baseline metrics and a short executive report
- No hard enforcement — docking is a recommended, auditable signal; managers can override

Why this matters:
- Reduces device fragmentation (no personal phones for work)
- Ensures devices are charged, available, and auditable for shift handoffs
- Quick measurable outcomes: fewer dropped tasks, faster task resolution, clearer handoffs

Pilot asks from you:
- 1 property, 4 devices, 2 docks (we can supply and manage)
- A manager sponsor to attend a 30–60 minute onboarding session
- Permission to collect a small set of operational metrics and conduct short staff surveys

Next steps
If you’re open to exploring this, I’d love 15 minutes to explain the pilot in more detail and see if it’s a fit. If you know a manager who’d be ideal, an introduction would be hugely helpful.

Thanks for considering — I’m happy to share anonymized results with participants.

Best,
Demond J Balentine
