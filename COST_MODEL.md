# Cost Model — 3-Property Pilot and Scaling Estimates

This document gives an itemized cost model for the 3-property pilot (12 active devices, 2 spares), plus low/medium/high scenarios for scaling to 100 devices.

---

## Pilot (12 active devices + 2 spares = 14 devices)
Assumptions:
- Mid-range iPad (Wi‑Fi) — $450 each
- Rugged case / mount — $50 each
- Commercial dock — $120 each
- MDM license — $4/device/month
- Deployment/training one-time — $2,000
- Support & spares fund — $800

Line items (one-time):
- iPads: 14 × $450 = $6,300
- Cases: 14 × $50 = $700
- Docks: 12 × $120 = $1,440
- Deployment/training: $2,000
- Spares & misc: $800

Pilot One-time subtotal = $11,240

Recurring (3-month pilot):
- MDM: 12 × $4 × 3 = $144
- Basic support fund: $600

Pilot Recurring (3 months) = $744

Estimated Total Pilot Budget ≈ $12,000 (rounded)

Notes:
- Prices vary by reseller and device model. iPad mini or refurbished devices can reduce cost.
- Volume discounts will apply when scaling; Apple Business / reseller pricing is recommended.

## Scale Estimate: 100 Devices (approx)
Three price scenarios: Low / Medium / High

Per-device cost elements:
- Device (low/med/high): $300 / $450 / $650
- Case/mount: $30 / $50 / $80
- Dock (per 1 device or shared): $80 / $120 / $200
- MDM/month: $2 / $4 / $8
- Deployment per device (one-time amortized): $15 / $25 / $40

Totals (approx, one-time + first-year recurring)

1) Low-cost scenario (refurbished / lower-cost dock)
- One-time hardware: 100×($300+$30+$80) = $41,000
- Deployment/training (one-time): $2,500
- First-year recurring (MDM + support): (100×$2×12) + $5,000 = $7,400
- First-year total ≈ $50k

2) Medium scenario (new mid-range iPads)
- One-time hardware: 100×($450+$50+$120) = $62,000
- Deployment/training (one-time): $7,000
- First-year recurring (MDM + support): (100×$4×12) + $10,000 = $58,800
- First-year total ≈ $128,000

3) High-cost scenario (premium devices + commercial docks + higher support)
- One-time hardware: 100×($650+$80+$200) = $93,000
- Deployment/training: $12,000
- First-year recurring (MDM + support): (100×$8×12) + $20,000 = $116,000
- First-year total ≈ $221,000

Notes on scale:
- Many buyers will accept an OPEX model (hardware lease or device subscription) rather than CAPEX.
- Consider offering hardware-as-a-service: monthly device lease + service fee.
- Volume discounts from resellers and Apple Business will significantly reduce per-device price.

## Financing & Pricing Options to Offer Customers
- Option 1: Customer purchases devices outright. Lower monthly fees for software.
- Option 2: RelayPoint finances hardware; customer pays monthly device+software subscription. (Higher ARR, better retention.)
- Option 3: Hybrid: initial pilot price (discounted or free) in return for case study and 12-month contract.

## Recommended Pilot Pricing Proposal (example)
- One-time pilot setup fee: $2,500 (covers deployment + training)
- Hardware cost: bill at cost or include in pilot package (RelayPoint covers pilot hardware expense)
- Monthly software & support: $200/property for the pilot (covers MDM, support, and hosting)

## Next steps
- Get reseller quotes (Apple Business, CDW, Walmart Business) for exact device+dock pricing
- Consider refurbished vs new devices based on warranty/reliability tradeoffs
- Build per-property pricing templates for sales conversations
